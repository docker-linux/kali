# Kali Linux Docker Image Build Script (deprecated)

### Historical Repository Note

As far as I know, this repository holds the earliest known build scripts for creating a Kali Linux Docker image, with its first commit dating back to January 2014.

It was responsible for building the first public Kali Linux image on Docker Hub as far as I remember, `linux/kali`. It was also this image that was [initially used in the official repisotory](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-docker/-/blob/c6331cf746f991ec0f2f13aced7db518f20f0c09/Dockerfile#L1)
It was used by me to automate security scans in Continious Deploy pipelines and other things.

The script found here is nearly identical to the one first committed to the official `kali-docker` build scripts repository in May 2015. This repository is kept as a historical record of the original work.
